# Who does really care about climate change ?

## Introduction

Gender implication in environmental issues (consider only binary gender for the sake of simplicity).
- Personal observations
- Men carbon foot print versus women's (Sweden study)
- Women tend to be more concerned with environmental issues : more impacted and everyday life, more empathy ? (psychological approach)
- But women might have less scientific knowledge
Gender communication tools different. Men and women expected to address those topics through different angles and with different rethoric. Highlighted several times when studying social media texts such as reddit or tweet posts
However here, we're dealing with reported speech. What someone says has been intentionnally selected, taken out of context somehow and emphasized. 
Can we still find some clues from these artificial quotes, supporting the hypothesis that each speaker approaches ecology and other environmental issues depending on his / her gender ?



Abstract:  In the dailylife, women seem more involved in ecology than men. Indeed, among the people we meet, the proportion of women making ecological efforts seems to be higher than the one of men (vegetarianism, waste reduction, second hand, involvement in ecological associations etc...). In line with the thesis that women are more involved in ecology than men, in 2015, a study (2) conducted in 11 industrialised countries showed that women are more concerned about environmental issues and that a major difference between men and women is their willingness to take action against climate change. Moreover, another study (1) showed in 2021 that men in Sweden have a larger carbon footprint than women. However, in 2010, women in the US had less scientific knowledge than men on the subject (3). 

Therefore, the involvement of gender in ecology seems to differ from one field to another. But really establish a link between gender and involvement in ecology? The idea is to identify sub-fields of ecology and to study whether some are more attributed to men or women. Finally, we want to study if men and women speakers use the same communication tools.
