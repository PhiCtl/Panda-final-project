# Who does really care about climate change ?

## Introduction

Gender implication in environmental issues (consider only binary gender for the sake of simplicity).
- Personal observations
- Men carbon foot print versus women's (Sweden study)
- Women tend to be more concerned with environmental issues : more impacted and everyday life, more empathy ? (psychological approach)
- But women might have less scientific knowledge
Gender communication tools different. Men and women expected to address those topics through different angles and with different rethoric. Highlighted several times when studying social media texts such as reddit or tweet posts
However here, we're dealing with reported speech. What someone says has been intentionnally selected, taken out of context somehow and emphasized. 
Can we still find some clues from these artificial quotes, supporting the hypothesis that each speaker approaches ecology and other environmental issues depending on his / her gender ?

## Quotebank dataset

Present dataset 
*TODO include plot of all quotes distribution and explain*

## How do environment-linked topics evolve from 2015 to 2020 ? Among those quotes, what is the proportion of men and women speakers ?

*TODO Alix plot* + comments
